            Assessment of children is a statutory requirement of the EYFS, therefore, your key person will see what kind of things your child is interested in and then will base their planning for your child's leaming and development around this. You will be able to see your child's individual learning plan at any time, just ask your child's key person. 
            <!-- You can also request a working in partnership meeting with your child's key person at any time, to discuss your child's development and any worries you may have. Personal care routines We will endeavour to follow the daily routines for young children to support the pattern that you have implemented at home. Children will be given breakfast in the morning and have access to fresh fruit until lunch time. The children then have the opportunity to eat lunch and are offered fresh fruit again throughout the afternoon until they eat tea at 4p.m -->
